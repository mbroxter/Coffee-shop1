      <h1>RRP WARRIOR</h1>
    </div>
    <p class=".boldblack">
        My first webpage is dedicated to my mom. She is an RRP
        Warrior. RRP is also known as Recurrent Respiritory Papillomaosis
        I will send her the link and hopefully she likes the nice surprise!
    </p>
    <div class="h2">
        <h2>WHAT IS RRP?</h2>
     </div>
         <p>  The first thing that comes up when you Google "RRP" is recommended 
            retail price. The definition my family familiar with is actually not 
            even on the whole first page of the Google search. That is how rare 
            this disease is. The disease is defined by the recurrent wart-like 
            growths that occur on the surface of the vocal chords and even the 
            tissue surrounding the vocal chords. It is caused by specific types 
            of HPV (human papilloma virus). 
            
            * It is important to note that the strains of HPV that cause RRP are 
            not always transmitted sexually. In my mom's case, she contracted the                 
            6 and/or 11 strain in the birth canal. This is also very rare, but still
            possible.*  
         </p>
    <div class="h2">
         <h2>MY MOM IS THE 1%</h2>
    </div>
        <p> With RRP, tracheal disease is even less common and lung involvment 
            occurs in less than 1% of patients. My mom is the (less than) 1%. 
            The rate at which the nodules and lesions grow in all affected 
            are sporadic and unpredictable. According to <a href="https://www.mountsinai.org" target="_blank">mountsinai.org</a>, RRP 
            affects roughly 2,000 people in the United States. This means she is 
            1 of the less than 20 people in the U.S. with RRP with lung involvment.</p>
    <div class="h2">
         <h2>BOSTON</h2>
    </div>
        <p> My mom recently took a trip to boston and was able to
            visit with Dr. Sara Pai. During her trip, her doctor took the time
            to look at her medical history in great detail and was able to 
            give her a guess on how many surgeries she has had since she was a 
            little girl. This number was 50! I am so <em>proud</em> of how my mom has handled
            these procedures and I hope she knows this!

        <h2>SURGERIES/PROCEDURES</h2>
    </div>
        <p>Below is the list of the types of surgeries/procedures that she has 
            undergone and will continue to recieve... 
            <ul>
                <li>GROWTH REMOVAL IN THE TRACHEA</li>
                <li>GROWTH REMOVAL IN THE VOACL CHORDS</li>
                <li>GROWTH REMOVAL IN TISSUE SURROUNDING UVULA</LI>
                <li>BRONCHOSOPES TO CHECK AIRWAYS
                <li>BIOPSY OF THE LUNGS</li>
                <li>CT SCANS</li>
                <li>MRIs</li>
                <li>AVASTIN CLINICAL TRIAL</li>
                    This included an series of 5 injections at once every 3 weeks to start.
                    This time period changed according to how it made her feel with side
                    effects. (Every 4 weeks, then every 6 weeks, then 10 weeks, then 12 weeks, 
                    and back to 6 weeks, until she decided the side effects weren't worth the 
                    the outcomes she was recieving.)
                <li>KEYTRUDA INFUSIONS</li>
                    Infusions every 3 weeks paired with a CT scan every 3 months.<br>
                    These procedures have been performed multiple times over the course 
                    of her lifetime which is where the number 50 came from earlier in the page!
